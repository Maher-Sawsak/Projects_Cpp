//Why its Called Bitwise Because its Callcualted bit by bit for that Reason.

//	Note(That Is In Logical Operator) :
//  1 || 1 = 1
//	1 || 0 = 1
//	0 || 1 = 1
//  0 || 0 = 0
//  when you have one true the Result will be True.

//How it work Bitwise Operator.
// 
//The Compiler Convert 12 To Binary and 25 TO Binary Also 
//	Then it || 12 and 25 it will be like this -->:
//	12 = 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
//	||
//	25 = 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
//	---------------
//	=    0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1  = 29(in decimal)
