// Exception Handling _ Try Catch

/*

Exceptions help prevent crashes when something goes wrong (like accessing out-of-range elements).

Very important Note:
But they should be used only when necessary, because they can slow down the program.

try = risky code That you think will be.
 catch = what to do if it fails.
